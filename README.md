This repo contains my work on the mass-radius(-flux) relation for small 
(and large) exoplanets!

Recent publications can be found here:
"Masses and Radii for 65 Exoplanets Smaller than 4 Earth Radii"
http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/783/1/L6

and here:
"The Mass of KOI-94d and a Relation for Planet Radius, Mass, and Incident Flux"
http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/768/1/14

The driving code is in two files:

write_exoplanet_table.ipynb -- read csv files and tables containing exoplanet properties, hard code some extra information, and output csv and pickle files with relevant info.

plot_mr.ipynb -- read exoplanet properties and make some cool plots, including the density-radius and mass-radius plots.
